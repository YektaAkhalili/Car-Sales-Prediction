Predicting Car Sales

This here is a Time Series Data. Some of the Pre-processing Analysis is done using Minitab, that I won't post on Github. The ARIMA modeling in done using R. 

Then an SVM Classification algorithm is implementated to decide if the future sales is going to be higher or lower than the average sales of the store. 

This is a project for a class at University.
